        This xml file is part of the project called "IUNI".
        It's a simple text adventure game, where you can walk around 
        and interact with characters and items, in order to regain your memory.

        This file contains all the information regarding command words and their description.

        For each <command> node there are two attributes:
            *"name" : the identifier with the command. To add aliases just separate them with a single "/"

            *"parameters" : the parameters of the command. Otherwise what the command requires to 
            function. To specifiy various parameters, separate them with a single space.
        
        The text content of each <command> node is the description of the command.

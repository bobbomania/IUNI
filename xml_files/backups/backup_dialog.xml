    This xml file is part of the project called "IUNI".
    It's a simple text adventure game, where you can walk around 
    and interact with characters and items, in order to regain your memory.

    This file contains all the data handled during the dialogue between the player and 
    an NPC (or the game itself).
    
    Element Nodes key:
        -> <allDialog> :
            is the root node used just as a container for all other nodes.

        -> <dialog> : 
            is the node that specifies the dialog for a certain NPC.
        
        -> <interaction> :
            is the node that specifies any interaction that satisfies various conditions specified by its attributes.
        
        -> <message> :
            is the node that specifies a message if an interaction's condition has been satisfied

        -> <choice> :
            is the node that specifies a choice of an answer given by the player to an NPC's question

    Attributes of Element Nodes Key:
        -> In <dialog> : 
            * name=NPC_name : assigns the following dialog to an NPC with name NPC_name
        
        -> in <interaction> :
            * condition="room" : the room in which the NPC will have said interaction. Leave "default" if
            the interaction happens in any room.

            * specialCondition="conditionFunctionKey attribute" : is the special condition that must be 
            satisfied for an interaction to occur. Otherwise it can be used by the npc to perform an
            action or to set a variable.

            * unmatched="string" : the response if the special condition isn't satisfied.

            * totalRepetitions="int" : an integer that tells us how many times left the player can perform an interaction.
            If it comes to 0, the interaction will be ignored.

        -> in <choice> :
            * id=string : a string that specifies the different responses that result in the choice taken 
            (they are separated by "/"). Substitue "default" in string if there is an unmatched choice.

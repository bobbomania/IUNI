This project is an implementation of a game exploring Alzheimer's disease, the game itself being called "IUNI".

Many various functions have been implemented to finish the game, and each command can be 
found in ./xml files/constants/CONST_COMMANDWORDS.xml .

The game's data and dialog too can be found in ./xml files/constants/ directory, where one can modify
this data following the guildelines in each .xml file.

To view the minigames within the game, go into the ./minigames folder and then there is a folder for each
of these games.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method. 

To assure proper playing experience, maximise the console window or terminal window.
